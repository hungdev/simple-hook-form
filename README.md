# React Simple Validation
inspired by react hook form and props name and rewritten in a simple way.

Don't hesitate to give me 1 star.

## Why don't use react-hook-form
I had some problems in react-hook-form and I couldn't handle it, and I decided to write my own. The library is in basic and simple form and has basic features like hook-form side, you can also fork and edit as you like. 


To do next tasks:
- [x] Validation
- [ ] Apply Joi schema
- [ ] Init default value in Field
- [ ] Init default state useForm
- [ ] Init default validation
- [ ] Reset
- [ ] Trigger => validate one or multiple or all fields, if dont pass params => all, pass string => one, ['field1,'field2'] => validate each element in array
- [ ] unregister field => remove fields in list validation fields
